## Overview
### Description
A social media application that matches people with similar fashion tastes based on brand choices and allows them to interact

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Photo and Video / Social
- **Mobile:** Uses camera, uses audio
- **Story:** Enables users share views on fashion items and discuss fashion tastes. Users may also share videos and images of latest fashion trends
- **Market:** People with interest in fashion and sharing their opinion would find this app helpful. Additionally, the grouping function of the app allows even casual fashion-lovers follow particular brands even though they aren't deeply invested in fashion.
- **Habit:** Multiple group chats and constant updates on newest fashion items available make the app easily habit-forming especially to the target market
- **Scope:** The basic version of the app is still a very pursuable idea for an application since having constant updates and discussions on the growing fashion world is a marketeable idea. In the long-run, as with other social media applications, it will evolve to encompass many more features.
